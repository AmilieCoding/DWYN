# Does What You Need
Does What You Need, also known as DWYN, is a Discord bot written in Discord.PY which aims to make a simple, effective and easy way to moderate your server, interact with members and keep your community safe while also being completely free and open source.<br>
<br>
# Planned Features
DWYN has many planned features including but not limited to:
- An Effective Moderation System
- Community Protection Methods
- Ease of Use for Administration
- Role Management
<br>
# Running on your own system.
DWYN is simple to host yourself, just download the repository and using pip manually install the depencies listed in dependencies.txt. You can then open bot.py in your chosen text editor (VSCode for me.) and run bot.py. It will error out about a token, to fix this just go to .env and where it says "[REDACTED FOR SECURITY]" put in *YOUR* generated bot token. When pushing to GitHub you *MUST* remove this bot token. Failure to do so will result in your removal from the project.<br>

Disclaimer: DWYN is an open source bot created by people who are just experimenting, in the case of something going wrong the developers, or people who commit to this GitHub repository, cannot and will not be held accountable. By using this software you agree to said terms.
